The base files for a sensor based garden automation project.
So far the code is capable of monitoring soil moisture and light levels and
temperature.
The actual sensors used are not documented as yet but are essentially voltage
dividers.
Image files of these will be posted here at a later date. The project in this
instance has been created in Eclipse to allow use of the IDE.
It is set to use a USBTiny hardware programmer rather than USART.
Further the entire Eclipse settings have been bundled into this repository.
It is highly likely that the paths to the libraries needed for AVRDude and AVR-C
and AVR-GCC are going to be different than yours. This was built on a MAc and
uses CrossPack. http://www.obdev.at/products/crosspack/index.html
There are further instructions on configuring Eclipse for AVR development here
http://interactive-matter.eu/how-to/developing-software-for-the-atmel-avr-with-avr-eclipse-avr-gcc-avrdude/
Bear in mind that the paths will probably be different for you than me.
The project is written in C and there is a small amount of wheel reinvention
mainly as I like to poke under the hood and I do not use the Arduino
environment.
I intend to add networking capabilities to this project using initially
JeeNodes and also porting the project to Nanode.

More documentation will be added as and when, the project is intended to evolve
into a small 'Kernel' for AVR based sensor based networked projects.
